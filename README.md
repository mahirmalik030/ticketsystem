The Ticket Reservation System is a Java-based console application designed to manage seat bookings for an event or transportation service, such as a theater, cinema, or airline
The system allows users to book, cancel, and manage seats across different categories (Economy, Premium, VIP) while maintaining a record of transactions and enabling undo functionalities for both bookings and cancellations. It uses data structures like HashSet for tracking booked seats and Stack for managing booking and cancellation history, ensuring efficient operations and user-friendly interaction.
The system provides a menu-driven interface where users can perform various operations, such as checking seat availability, viewing all bookings, and managing transactions with validation checks to ensure data integrity (e.g., matching seat numbers with categories). It is designed to be simple, scalable, and extensible for future enhancements, such as adding a graphical user interface (GUI) or integrating with a database.
